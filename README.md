## Introduction

RetroTK (RTK) is an example of how to implement the Mithia server source code to create a private server. RTK is not a live game. It is an instructional tool and potential starting point to help those who wish to build and run their own game.

**Please join the [RetroTK Discord](https://discord.gg/HxBzqweqdV) if you have questions or want to discuss the project with others.**
